Here's a very simplified example of how this might look in Python, using a hypothetical emotion analysis and recommendation library:

   import emotion_analysis
   import content_recommendation

   # User input
   user_input = "I'm feeling really happy today!"

   # Analyze emotion
   emotion = emotion_analysis.analyze(user_input)

   # Recommend content
   recommended_content = content_recommendation.recommend(emotion)

   print(recommended_content)
